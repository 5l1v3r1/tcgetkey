What is tcgetkey?
=================

This is my simple (ugly) PoC at recovering TrueCrypt keys from memory dumps 
gathered from linux systems using the FireWire bus. It will then use the
recovered keys to decrypt the volume.


It contains 2 programs:

get_mem_dump	gets the memory image via firewire
tcgetkey	scans the dump and decrypts the volume


In order to identify the keys, a new approach was employed, by calculating 
and comparing Shannon entropy of certain memory regions.

This is a very rough PoC with probably a lot of stupid bugs in the code.




How to build tcgetkey?
======================

Just run 'make'. You'll need the following:

openssl-dev		 for the AES routines
libforensic1394		 for the FireWire code


You can get OpenSSL from:
http://www.openssl.org/

You can get libforensic1394 from:
https://freddie.witherden.org/tools/libforensic1394/



How to use the tools?
=====================

You should first acquire a memory dump, by typing:

sudo ./get_mem_dump memory_dump.image

Then you should obtain the truecrypt container (e.g tc.image) and analyze it:

./tcgetkey memory_dump.image tc.image decrypted.image

If it successfully finds your keys, it would attempt to decrypt the whole volume.
You would get instructions on how to proceed, but it's basically:

losetup /dev/loopX decrypted.image
mount /dev/loopX /mnt/decrypted



Limitations
===========

tcgetkeys supports only physical memory images gathered from Linux hosts.
It is (well sort of) kernel/architecture-independent except that it only supports little-endian ones now.

Hidden volumes are not supported (this is pending further investigation).



Disclaimer
==========

DO NOT use the tools to illegally break into encrypted containers.
I am not responsible for any harm these tools can do on your systems.
